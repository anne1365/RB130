  PROBLEM: given a phrase, program should output occurences of each word in the
  phrase
    
    INPUT:  string
    OUTPUT: a hash in which they keys are (lowercase) words appearing in phrase,
            and values are # of occurences
    
    QUESTIONS: 
    - How to split words up while disregarding punctuation and case?
      clean_str = str.downcase.scan(/[ a-z0-9']/i).join
    - How to match quoted words?
      str.scan(/(')([a-z0-9]+)(')/i)
    - How to remove qutations for count?
      str.scan(/(')([a-z0-9]+)(')/i).join[1..-2]
    - ^^ Doesn't account for multiple quoted words
      need to see if a string starts or ends with single quote, and remove that

    RULES:
    - algo needs to count words without regard for puncutation
    - algo counts words case insensitively
    - algo must count words with apostrophes without removing apostrophes
    - algo must count words between single quotes without accounting for 
      single quotes
    - algo must count numbers too

  DATA STRUCTURE: will work with downcased, filtered string split into array
  to yield hash

  ALGO:
   COUNT WORDS METHOD:
   - initialize hash `counts` - will hold counts of words
   - filter string with helper method
   - iterate through filtered string array using each
      - if word is present as key in hash, increment count
      - if not, add word and set count to 1

   CLEAN STRING (HELPER)
   - use regex to remove unnecessary punctuation
   - scan string for words within single quotes
   - if present, iterate through string array using map, and if a word starts 
     or ends with single quote, remove it (or them)
