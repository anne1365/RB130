 PROBLEM: write a method that converts an integer into roman numeral (string)
  INPUT:  integer
  OUTPUT: string
  
  QUESTIONS: 
  - how do I write this methodis such a way than an integer can invoke it (by writing it
    within the integer class even if it feels wrong - I wonder if there's a better way)
  
  RULES:
  I -> 1
  V -> 5
  X -> 10
  L -> 50
  C -> 100
  D -> 500
  M -> 1000

  - No need to be able to convert numbers above 3000
  - 

  DATA STRUCTURE: 

  ALGO:

=end

class Integer
  def to_roman
   puts 'why'
  end
end
