PROBLEM: given a word (string) and an array, return the element or
         elements of the array that are anagrams of the word

  INPUT: string
  OUTPUT: array
  RULES:
   - letters within argument word cannot be reused to form anagram
   - if there are no anagrams an empty array should be returned
   - if an array element contains extra letters that don't appear in
     argument, the element isn't an anagram
